# Usage

Most of these exercises require you to read in a file (generally named `input.txt`) and produce some output based on it.
The repository does not contain these input files, as they can grow quite large.
Instead, we provide a script that generates these.

Each exercise is accompanied by a verification script.
It checks the output of your script and if correct, gives you a verification key.
This verification key is now useless, but on exams this was the key you needed to upload to x.toledo to prove you solved the exercise.

## Suggested workflow

* If present, run `generate.py`.
* Read the problem statement.
* Write `student.py` that solves the problem.
* Run `verify.py` to check your solution is correct.
