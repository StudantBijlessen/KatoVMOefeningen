# Assignment

Oh no! We dropped the git log and now all commits are out of order!

The file `input.txt` contains an unordered list of commits:

Your task consists of ordering these commits so that they
appear in reverse chronological order (i.e., most recent commit first, oldest commit last):

```text

Author: Asif Van Esbroeck <asif.vanesbroeck@student.ucll.be>
