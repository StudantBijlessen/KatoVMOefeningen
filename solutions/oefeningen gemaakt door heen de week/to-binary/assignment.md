# Assignment

The file `input.txt` contains numbers written in decimal notation.
We want each of these numbers to be translated to binary notation.
For example, the number 8 should be translated to 1000.

Write each of these binary numbers to `output.txt`. The order
must be preserved.


## Example

```text
0
1
2
3
4
100
```

should produce the following output:

```text
0
1
10
11
100
1100100
```
